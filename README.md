## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I learnt so much after watching the JavaScript part of Justin Kim's calculator tutorial video. I used what i learnt to complete this app

### Continued development

After watching several tutorial videos I was able to complete this calculator web app;
I picked up several javascript syntaxes along the way.
So, going forward i will continue to enhance my skills in Javascript to continue to build more web apps.
